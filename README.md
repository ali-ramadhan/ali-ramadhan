### Hi, I'm Ali!

I am a graduate researcher at MIT working at the intersection of climate science, software engineering, and machine learning.

I write code for ocean models and use machine learning to improve how turbulence is represented in climate models.

You can find out more about me and my research on my personal website: http://aliramadhan.me/

Feel free to reach out to connect on anything weather and climate!
